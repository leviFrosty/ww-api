/**
 * Per-IP limits for the public routes outside Buddies (which has its own
 * tiers in src/buddies/limits.ts).
 *
 * One `RATE_LIMITER` binding (60 requests per 60 s in wrangler.toml), but each
 * route family counts in its own bucket: the key is `<family>:<client IP>`.
 * Before, every family shared one bucket per IP, so on congregation Wi-Fi or
 * carrier NAT a few people searching addresses could lock everyone behind
 * that IP out of Notes Import, and the reverse.
 *
 * What it still guards: no family gets more than it had (60/min per IP), so
 * the cost ceiling per IP for any one upstream (HERE place search, OpenRouter,
 * HERE routing) is unchanged; only the families no longer starve each other.
 * Address search and geocoding stay in one `places` bucket because both spend
 * HERE transactions. Behind each family sit stronger, identity-keyed limits
 * (Notes Import: App Attest or Play Integrity, allowances, the concurrency
 * cap; route planning: the per-account quota), which a client-supplied install
 * or account id can't replace here: before those checks it is unauthenticated,
 * so keying on it would let one caller mint fresh buckets at will.
